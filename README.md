# Rotorflight Configurator

Rotorflight Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the Rotorflight flight control system.

Rotorflight Configurator is forked from Betaflight Configurator.

## Installation

### Installation for End Users:

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases) page on this Github repo to download the _latest official release_ for your operating system.

Please ignore any snapshots on this page (github is showing them automatically).

### Installation for Beta-testers:

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases) page on this Github repo to download the latest _snapshot_ for your operating system.

Please note that snapshots are available for beta-testing, and are otherwise _not_ supported.

### Notes

#### Windows users

The minimum required version of windows is Windows 8.

#### MacOS X users

Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of MacOS X 10.14 (Mojave) and 10.15 (Catalina) mean that the operating system will show an error message ('"Rotorflight Configurator.app" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.') when trying to install the application. To work around this, run the following command in a terminal after installing: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rotorflight\ Configurator.app`.

#### Linux users

In most Linux distributions your user won't have access to serial interfaces by default. To add this access right type the following command in a terminal, log out your user and log in again:

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout ${USER}
```

#### Graphics Issues

If you experience graphics display problems or smudged/dithered fonts display issues in Rotorflight Configurator, try invoking the `rotorflight-configurator` executable file with the `--disable-gpu` command line switch. This will switch off hardware graphics acceleration. Likewise, setting your graphics card antialiasing option to OFF (e.g. FXAA parameter on NVidia graphics cards) might be a remedy as well.


### Development

1. Install node.js (refer to [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) for required version)
2. Install yarn: `npm install yarn -g`
3. (For Android platform only) Install Java JDK 8, Gradle and Android Studio (Android SDK at least level 19)
4. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
5. Run `yarn start`.

### Running tests

`yarn test`

### App build and release

The tasks are defined in `gulpfile.js` and can be run with through yarn:
```
yarn gulp <taskname> [[platform] [platform] ...]
```

List of possible values of `<task-name>`:
* **dist** copies all the JS and CSS files in the `./dist` folder [2].
* **apps** builds the apps in the `./apps` folder [1].
* **debug** builds debug version of the apps in the `./debug` folder [1][3].
* **release** zips up the apps into individual archives in the `./release` folder [1]. 

[1] Running this task on macOS or Linux requires Wine, since it's needed to set the icon for the Windows app (build for specific platform to avoid errors).
[2] For Android platform, **dist** task will generate folders and files in the `./dist_cordova` folder.
[3] For Android platform, you need to configure an emulator or to plug an Android device with USB debugging enabled

#### Build or release app for one specific platform

To build or release only for one specific platform you can append the plaform after the `task-name`.
If no platform is provided, the build for the host platform is run.

* **MacOS X** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --osx64`
* **Linux** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --linux64` 
* **Windows** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --win32` 
* **Android** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --android`

**Note:** Support for cross-platform building is very limited due to the requirement for platform specific build tools. If in doubt, build on the target platform.

You can also use multiple platforms e.g. `yarn gulp <taskname> --osx64 --linux64`. Other platforms like `--win64`, `--linux32` and `--armv7` can be used too, but they are not officially supported, so use them at your own risk.
